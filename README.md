## Purpose

A repository along with a [wiki](https://github.com/BrockCSC/acm-icpc/wiki) for the Brock ICPC team or students with interest in the ICPC.

Post your solutions, libraries, or anything you think is helpful.


## How to use

If your work is a work-in-progress, create a separate branch for it. Once your work is complete (e.g. your library is finished or your solution gets an accepted answer), merge your work with the master branch.

If your work is completed before it's been added to this repo, you may add it directly to the master branch.
